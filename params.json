It is designed to handle an unlimited number of nodes\r\nwith minimal CPU and memory resources. Thanks to this feature it can be easily\r\nused to build a worldwide distributed, anonymous and not controlled network,\r\nseparated from the Internet, without the support of any servers, ISPs or\r\nauthority controls.\r\nThis net is composed by computers linked physically each other, therefore it\r\nisn't build upon any existing network. Netsukuku builds only the routes which\r\nconnects all the computers of the net.\r\nIn other words, Netsukuku replaces the level 3 of the model iso/osi with\r\nanother routing protocol.\r\nThe Domain Name System is also replaced by a decentralised and distributed\r\nsystem: the Abnormal Netsukuku Domain Name Anarchy.\r\n\r\nThe complete features list of Netsukuku is here:\r\nhttp://netsukuku.freaknet.org/files/doc/misc/Ntk_features_list\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to join to Netsukuku you have to use NetsukukuD, which is the daemon\r\nimplementing the Npv7 protocol.\r\n\r\nBefore doing anything, please read the documentation in doc/ or in\r\nhttp://netsukuku.freaknet.org\r\n\r\n## Get the code!\r\n\r\nGet the tarball of the latest stable version from:\r\nhttp://netsukuku.freaknet.org/files/\r\n\r\nOr use **github**:\r\n\r\n    $git clone git@github.com:Netsukuku/netsukuku.git \r\n\r\n## Build and install\r\n\r\nTo compile the code you can use scons or just go with the old school way:\r\n\r\n    # ./configure && make && make install\r\n\r\nBut SCons is cooler:\r\nhttp://www.scons.org/\r\n(You should have installed at least the 2.4 version of Python in order to\r\navoid dirty bugs in scons)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe code depends also on the libgmp,zlib and openssl. Generally you have\r\nalready them installed on your system, but eventually you can retrieve them\r\nhere:\r\nfor the libgmp: http://www.swox.com/gmp/\r\nthe openssl library here: http://openssl.org\r\nand finally the zlibs: http://zlib.net\r\n\r\nThen go in the src/ directory and type:\r\n    $ scons --help\r\n\r\nThat will show you all the options you can use in the build and installation\r\nprocess. Finally execute:\r\n\r\n    $ scons\r\n\r\nThe code will be compiled. If all went well install NetsukukuD with:\r\n\r\n    # scons install\r\n\r\nNow you should give a look at /etc/netsukuku.conf (or wherever you installed\r\nit) and modify it for your needs, but generally the default options are good.\r\n\r\n- Notes:\r\n\r\nIf you want to change some scons option to do another installation, (i.e. you\r\nmay want to reinstall it with another MANDIR path), you have to run:\r\n    $ scons --clean\r\n\r\n\r\n## Static Binaries and Packages\r\n\r\nIf you prefer to just install Netsukuku, without compiling it, you can\r\ndownload the static binaries suitable to your platform. They come packed in\r\nvarious formats (.tgz, .deb, .ipk).\r\nThe packages repository is at:\r\n    http://netsukuku.freaknet.org/packages/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Kernel dependencies\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Linux be sure to have the following options set in your kernel .config.\r\nThese options are taken from linux-2.6.14.\r\n \r\n\r\n Networking options\r\n\r\n    CONFIG_PACKET=y\r\n    CONFIG_UNIX=y\r\n    CONFIG_INET=y\r\n    CONFIG_IP_MULTICAST=y\r\n    CONFIG_IP_ADVANCED_ROUTER=y\r\n    CONFIG_IP_MULTIPLE_TABLES=y\r\n    CONFIG_IP_ROUTE_MULTIPATH=y\r\n    CONFIG_NET_IPIP=y\r\n    CONFIG_NETFILTER=y\r\n\r\nand these from linux-2.6.16.19.\r\n\r\n\r\n Core Netfilter Configuration\r\n\r\n\r\n    CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_CONNTRACK=y\r\n    NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_CONNMARK=y\r\n\r\n\r\n IP: Netfilter Configuration\r\n\r\n    CONFIG_IP_NF_IPTABLES=y\r\n    CONFIG_IP_NF_FILTER=y\r\n    CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_REJECT=y\r\n    CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT=y\r\n    CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT_NEEDED=y\r\n    CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_MASQUERADE=y\r\n\r\nIf you are using modules you have to load them before launching the daemon.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to use it\r\n\r\nBefore doing anything do:\r\n\r\n    $ man ntkd\r\n    $ man andna\r\n\r\nwhen you feel confortable and you are ready to dare type with root\r\npriviledges:\r\n\r\n    # ntkd\r\n\r\nthen just wait... ^_-\r\n\r\n(For the first times it's cool to use the -D option to see what happens).\r\n\r\n- Note:\r\nThe daemon at startup takes the list of all the network interfaces which are\r\ncurrently UP and it uses all of them to send and receive packets. If you want\r\nto force the daemon to use specific interfaces you should use the B<-i>\r\noption.\r\n\r\n## Where to get in touch with us\r\n\r\n> Mailing list\r\n\r\nSubscribe to the netsukuku mailing to get help, be updated on the latest news\r\nand discuss on its development.\r\n\r\nTo subscribe to the list, send a message to:\r\n    netsukuku-subscribe@lists.dyne.org\r\nor use the web interface:\r\n    http://lists.dyne.org/mailman/listinfo/netsukuku\r\n   \r\nYou can browse the archive here:\r\n    http://lists.dyne.org/netsukuku/\r\n    http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.network.peer-to-peer.netsukuku\r\n \r\n\r\n> IRC\r\n\r\nWe live night and day in IRC, come to see us on channel  #netsukuku\r\non the FreeNode irc server (irc.freenode.org).\r\n\r\n## Bug report\r\n\r\n{ Don't panic! }\r\n\r\nIf you encounter any bug, please report it.\r\nUse the online bug track system:\r\n    http://bugs.dyne.org/\r\nor the mailing list:\r\n    http://lists.dyne.org/netsukuku/\r\nand explain what the problem is and if possible a way to reproduce it.\r\n\r\n## Hack the code\r\n\r\nFeel free to debug, patch, modify and eat the code.
